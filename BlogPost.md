# The Ghost of Reproducibility 

We think it would be a good idea to write a survey paper about reproducibility of computational experiments.  And we want to write that paper with **YOU**. 

Why?  

Because we think it's important to have a paper summarising the state of the art in reproducibility, and the challenges that we face in ensuring reproducibility in the future.  

And because we want want that paper to be good the best way to do it is to crowdsource the task - in this way we should avoid missing things that should we covered, and at the same time have all parts of the paper written by people who know what they are talking about. 

And we can't think of a better place to find people who know about the possibilities and challenges in reproducibility in computational experiments than the Software Sustainability Institute. 

#### What the paper is about

Our current draft title is: Reproducibility in Computer Science: Past, Present and Future

As the title suggests, we want to break the survey into three parts. 

#### The ghost of reproducibility past

In some sense the easy bit of writing about reproducibility is to write about the past.  This is classic ``survey paper" territory.  
What has been done - good and bad - on reproducibility in the past. While the answer is often "not nearly enough" there has been a lot of work done and most people remain ignorant of it. Those ignorant of history are doomed to repeat it, and that means at worst doing irreproducible research, and most of the rest of the time reinventing wheels that have been reinvented many times before.  
Putting together a good survey of what has been done should greatly help researchers get a quick handle on what has been standard practice in reproducibility in computing.

#### How Should We Do This?

We want to make it as easy as possible to collaborate with you. 

#### Author Credit

We absolutely want to give you author credit for working on this paper. If this paper then ends up with 10 authors or 20, that is fine by us.
